## Fashion Image Classification using CNN and Pretrained Models

## Project Overview

This project involves building a custom CNN model along with multiple pretrained models to classify fashion items into categories such as shirts, dresses, and footwear. The models leverage preprocessing techniques and regularization to improve accuracy and are designed for integration into real-time applications.

## Tools Used

-**Python – Data preprocessing and model implementation**

-**TensorFlow & Keras – Building and training CNN and pretrained models**

## Key Highlights

-**Developed a custom CNN model for fashion image classification**

-**Utilized multiple pretrained models (e.g., ResNet, VGG) to enhance accuracy**

-**Applied preprocessing techniques including resizing, normalization, and one-hot encoding**

-**Implemented dropout and other regularization methods for improved generalization**

-**Achieved high test accuracy and exported the models for real-time application deployment**

## Data

-**Fashion images dataset with labeled categories for training and testing**

-**Preprocessed for optimal model performance**
